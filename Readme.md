# Project 2 - Self-List

A shopping item creating that allows you to keep track of what you need to buy, edit, delete, and update.

Can also create household List and Manage different list's

## Technolgies used
Node.js, Mongoose, Express and JSX

Used MVC File Structure

We have 1 model with 7 RESTful routes and Full CRUD

## Difficulties
- Tried adding a household input in the user schema and the shopping item schema. This would allow the user to create items for their own list and a household list.

## Improvements
 Creating the household Authorization user with Admin responsabilities to delete and edit, to allow for edit hiarchy,

 exporting the data string to email or text to send to the purchasing party - looked into it and started messing with it, Curveball was the php code since mongo db can only export with as JSON or CSV file.
 Figured PHP language can be thrown in with HTML and should be a couple of more days of research.
